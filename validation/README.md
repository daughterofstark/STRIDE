# `validation/` — STRIDE validation & benchmarking framework (Phase 2)

This package is **completely separate** from the production `mechanism` package and
implements the validation study described in `../VALIDATION_ROADMAP.md` (milestones
V0–V8). It is a research/dev package, **not** part of the shipped `mechanism`
distribution.

## Separation invariants (must hold at every milestone)

1. `validation/` lives outside the packaged `src/` tree, so building or installing
   `mechanism` is identical with or without it (`pyproject.toml` packages only
   `src/`).
2. `mechanism` never imports `validation` — there is **no** reverse dependency.
   Deleting this directory leaves Phase 1 (M0–M6) fully functional and golden-green.
3. `validation` imports `mechanism` only through its **documented public API**
   (`mechanism.Config`, `mechanism.run_pipeline`, and the documented submodule
   functions). At V0 it imports nothing from `mechanism`.
4. Validation tests live under `validation/tests/`, outside the production
   `testpaths = ["tests"]`, so a production test run never collects them.
5. All randomness flows through `validation._seed` (seeded, reproducible, recorded).

## V0 contents

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `_seed.py` | deterministic seeded RNG layer (`make_rng`, `spawn_seeds`) |
| `types.py` | ground-truth data contract (`GroundTruthSystem`, `RegionTruth`, `SimResult`, `SweepCell`) |
| `cli.py` | skeleton CLI with placeholder subcommands |
| `tests/` | separation guard, determinism, and data-contract tests |

## Running the validation tests

The validation suite is intentionally separate from the production suite:

```bash
# from the repository root
python -m pytest validation/tests
```

(The data contract and seeds are pure Python + numpy; no MDAnalysis/POVME needed.)
